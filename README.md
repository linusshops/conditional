# Conditional

The purpose of this Magento module is to open up the possibility to
conditionally `rewrite` code based on a given context. For example, if two 
modules are competing to rewrite layered navigation functionality across an
entire site, but only one module should rewrite the standard layered
navigation in category listings, while the other should rewrite the layered
navigation on search results, this module will contextualize the rewrite so
the relevant one is used.

## Note

This is still a work in progress.

## TODO

- Complete documentation
- Write more functionality
